  <h1 id="rfc.section.1">
<a href="#rfc.section.1">1.</a> <a href="#introduction" id="introduction">Introduction</a>
</h1>
<p id="rfc.section.1.p.1">Of the great many contributions Jon Postel made to the Internet, his remarkable technical achievements are often ignored in favor of the design and implementation philosophy that he first captured in the original IPv4 specification <a href="#RFC0760" class="xref">[RFC0760]</a>:</p>
<p></p>

<ul class="empty"><li>In general, an implementation should be conservative in its sending behavior, and liberal in its receiving behavior.</li></ul>
<p id="rfc.section.1.p.3">In comparison, his contributions to the underpinnings of the Internet, which are in many respects more significant, enjoy less conscious recognition.  Postel&#8217;s principle has been hugely influential in shaping the Internet and the systems that use Internet protocols.  Many consider this principle to be instrumental in the success of the Internet as well as the design of interoperable protocols in general.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.1.p.4">Over time, considerable changes have occurred in both the scale of the Internet and the level of skill and experience available to protocol and software designers.  Much of that experience is with protocols that were designed, informed by Postel&#8217;s maxim, in the early phases of the Internet.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.1.p.5">That experience shows that there are negative long-term consequences to interoperability if an implementation applies Postel&#8217;s advice.  Correcting the problems caused by divergent behavior in implementations can be difficult.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.1.p.6">It might be suggested that the posture Postel advocates was indeed necessary during the formative years of the Internet, and even key to its success.  This document takes no position on that claim.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.1.p.7">This document instead describes the negative consequences of the application of Postel&#8217;s principle to the modern Internet.  A replacement design principle is suggested.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.1.p.8">There is good evidence to suggest that designers of protocols in the IETF widely understand the limitations of Postel&#8217;s principle.  This document serves primarily as a record of the shortcomings of His principle for the wider community.</p>
<h1 id="rfc.section.2">
<a href="#rfc.section.2">2.</a> <a href="#time" id="time">Protocol Decay</a>
</h1>
<p id="rfc.section.2.p.1">Divergent implementations of a specification emerge over time.  When variations occur in the interpretation or expression of semantic components, implementations cease to be perfectly interoperable.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.2.p.2">Implementation bugs are often identified as the cause of variation, though it is often a combination of factors.  Application of a protocol to new and unanticipated uses, and ambiguities or errors in the specification are often confounding factors.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.2.p.3">Of course, situations where two peers disagree are common, and should be expected over the lifetime of a protocol.  Even with the best intentions, the pressure to interoperate can be significant.  No implementation can hope to avoid having to trade correctness for interoperability indefinitely.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.2.p.4">An implementation that reacts to variations in the manner advised by Postel sets up a feedback cycle:</p>
<p></p>

<ul>
<li>Over time, implementations progressively add new code to constrain how data is transmitted, or to permit variations in what is received.</li>
<li>Errors in implementations, or confusion about semantics can thereby be masked.</li>
<li>These errors can become entrenched, forcing other implementations to be tolerant of those errors.</li>
</ul>
<p id="rfc.section.2.p.6">For example, the original JSON specification <a href="#RFC4627" class="xref">[RFC4627]</a> omitted critical details on a range of points including Unicode handling, ordering and duplication of object members, and number encoding.  Consequently, a range of interpretations were used by implementations.  An update <a href="#RFC7159" class="xref">[RFC7159]</a> was unable to correct these errors, instead concentrating on defining the interoperable subset of JSON.  I-JSON <a href="#RFC7493" class="xref">[RFC7493]</a> defines a new format that is substantially similar to JSON without the interoperability flaws. I-JSON also intentionally omits some interoperability: an I-JSON implementation will fail to accept some valid JSON texts.  Consequently, most JSON parsers do not implement I-JSON.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.2.p.7">An entrenched flaw can become a de facto standard.  Any implementation of the protocol is required to replicate the aberrant behavior, or it is not interoperable.  This is both a consequence of applying Postel&#8217;s advice, and a product of a natural reluctance to avoid fatal error conditions.  Ensuring interoperability in this environment is often colloquially referred to as aiming to be &#8220;bug for bug compatible&#8221;.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.2.p.8">It is debatable as to whether decay can be completely avoided, but Postel&#8217;s maxim encourages a reaction that compounds this issue.</p>
<h1 id="rfc.section.3">
<a href="#rfc.section.3">3.</a> <a href="#the-long-term-costs" id="the-long-term-costs">The Long Term Costs</a>
</h1>
<p id="rfc.section.3.p.1">Once deviations become entrenched, there is little that can be done to rectify the situation.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.3.p.2">For widely used protocols, the massive scale of the Internet makes large-scale interoperability testing infeasible for all but a privileged few.  As the set of changes needed to maintain interoperability grows in size, the cost of building a new implementation increases.  This is particularly relevant as the set of tweaks necessary for interoperability can be difficult to learn.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.3.p.3">Consequently, new implementations can be restricted to niche uses, where the problems arising from interoperability issues can be more closely managed.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.3.p.4">This has a negative impact on the ecosystem of a protocol.  New implementations are important in ensuring the continued viability of a protocol.  New protocol implementations are also more likely to be developed for new and diverse use cases and often are the origin of features and capabilities that can be of benefit to existing users.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.3.p.5">These problems also reduce the ability of established implementations to change.  The accumulation of interoperability mitigations can be difficult to maintain, or even recognize in software.</p>
<h1 id="rfc.section.4">
<a href="#rfc.section.4">4.</a> <a href="#recognizing-the-need-for-protocol-maintenance" id="recognizing-the-need-for-protocol-maintenance">Recognizing the Need for Protocol Maintenance</a>
</h1>
<p id="rfc.section.4.p.1">Postel&#8217;s maxim is specifically valuable if the specification of a protocol is intended to remain unchanged for an extended period of time.  Indeed, in the face of divergent interpretations of an immutable specification, the only hope for an implementation to remain widely interoperable is to be tolerant of differences in interpretation and occasional outright implementation errors.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.4.p.2">From this perspective, application of Postel&#8217;s advice to the implementation of a protocol specification that does not change is logical, even necessary.  But that suggests that the problem is with the presumption of immutability of specifications.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.4.p.3">Active maintenance of a protocol can ensure that specifications remain accurate and that new implementations are possible.  A maintained protocol is not a static construct, it improves and changes as it is used.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.4.p.4">Protocol designers are strongly encouraged to continue to maintain and evolve protocols beyond their initial inception and definition.  Maintenance is needed in response to the discovery of errors in specification that might cause interoperability issues.  Maintenance is also critical for ensuring that the protocol is viable for application to use cases that might not have been envisaged during its original design.  New use cases are an indicator that the protocol could be successful <a href="#SUCCESS" class="xref">[SUCCESS]</a>.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.4.p.5">Maintenance does not demand the development of new versions of protocols or protocol specifications.  For instance, RFC 793 <a href="#TCP" class="xref">[TCP]</a> remains the canonical TCP reference, but that document alone is no longer sufficient to implement the protocol.  TCP is the subject of a very large number of update and extension RFCs that together document the deployed protocol.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.4.p.6">Good extensibility <a href="#EXT" class="xref">[EXT]</a> can make it easier to respond to new use cases or changes in the environment in which the protocol is deployed.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.4.p.7">The process of maintenance ideally begins even before the specification for a protocol is complete.  Neglect can quickly produce the negative consequences this document describes.  Restarting maintenance could involve first discovering the properties of the protocol as it is deployed, rather than the protocol as it was originally document.  This can be time-consuming, particularly if the protocol has a diverse set of implementations.  Such a process was undertaken for HTTP <a href="#HTTP" class="xref">[HTTP]</a> after a period of minimal maintenance.  Restoring the specification to currency took significant effort over more than 6 years.</p>
<h1 id="rfc.section.5">
<a href="#rfc.section.5">5.</a> <a href="#the-role-of-feedback" id="the-role-of-feedback">The Role of Feedback</a>
</h1>
<p id="rfc.section.5.p.1">Protocol maintenance is only possible if there is sufficient information about the implementation, deployment and use of the protocol.  A such, feedback is critical to effective maintenance.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.5.p.2">For a protocol specification, the primary and most effective form of feedback comes from people who implement or deploy the protocol.  An active community around a particular protocol is the most valuable source of feedback.  It is the community that implements and deploys changes, in addition to contributing to the ongoing maintenance of protocol specifications.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.5.p.3">A community benefits from having a venue for discussion.  An outlet where questions, issues, or new use cases can be taken can also be where maintenance occurs.  Ensuring that the venue remains available ensures that critical feedback is not lost for lack of a medium for providing it.  This might mean retaining mailing lists, specification repositories, and issue trackers past the point that a specification is initially published.  The easier it is for an individual to provide feedback on their own terms, the more likely they are to provide it.</p>
<h2 id="rfc.section.5.1">
<a href="#rfc.section.5.1">5.1.</a> <a href="#fault-reporting-is-valuable" id="fault-reporting-is-valuable">Fault Reporting is Valuable</a>
</h2>
<p id="rfc.section.5.1.p.1">Protocol implementations should to include error reporting mechanisms that ensure errors are surfaced in a visible and expedient fashion.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.5.1.p.2">Exposing faults through operations and management systems is highly valuable, but it might be necessary to ensure that the information is propagated.  Building telemetry and error logging systems that report faults to the developers of the implementation is superior in many respects.  However, this is only possible in deployments that are conducive to the collection of this type of information.  Due consideration to protecting the privacy of protocol participants is critical prior to deploying any such system.</p>
<h2 id="rfc.section.5.2">
<a href="#rfc.section.5.2">5.2.</a> <a href="#the-role-of-fatal-errors" id="the-role-of-fatal-errors">The Role of Fatal Errors</a>
</h2>
<p id="rfc.section.5.2.p.1">The primary failing of automated reporting systems is their inability to recognize and collect information about abberant conditions.  Generating fatal errors in place of attempting recovery can ensure that faults are immediately visible.  For instance, a practice of triggering a crash in response to unexpected conditions allows a generic crash reporting system to be used to identify faults.  Fatal errors or crashes are also preferable if there is any risk that the error might represent an implementation or security issue.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.5.2.p.2">A fatal error provides excellent motivation for addressing problems.  In contrast, generating warnings provide no incentive to fix a problem as the system remains operational.  Generating fatal errors is only feasible if such errors are sufficiently rare.  Users can become inured to problems if they are frequent and ignore them, whereas rare events demand greater attention.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.5.2.p.3">Exposing errors is particularly important for early implementations of a protocol.  This helps validate a protocol during its design.  If early implementations are then used more widely, having those implementations generate errors in response to divergent behavior better enables the detection and correction of errors in new implementations.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.5.2.p.4">This doesn&#8217;t mean that protocol implementations need to treat all inputs equally strictly.  A protocol might be intentionally designed to be tolerant of a wide range of inputs (see for example <a href="#HTML" class="xref">[HTML]</a>).  As long as proper reactions to inputs are clearly and unambiguously specified, these considerations don&#8217;t apply.</p>
<h1 id="rfc.section.6">
<a href="#rfc.section.6">6.</a> <a href="#implementations-are-ultimately-responsible" id="implementations-are-ultimately-responsible">Implementations Are Ultimately Responsible</a>
</h1>
<p id="rfc.section.6.p.1">Implementations and deplotments are critical to the ongoing maintenance of a protocol.  Implementation, deployment and use of a protocol is the primary source of information about that protocol.  The application of any tool to real use cases is where problems and use cases are discovered.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.6.p.2">Implementations have ample motivation to prefer stability and interoperability over maintenance or correctness.  It is likely that - over time - an implementation will accumulate allowances for errors of specification or implementation.  This can lead to suppression of feedback about errors.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.6.p.3">Even when an implementation chooses to attempt to adapt to an abnormal condition, communicating that decision to the community minimally allows others to benefit from knowledge of the problem.  Discussion about problems might also lead to alternative strategies or protocol enhancements that can avoid further problems.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.6.p.4">Over time, mitigations for interoperability issues could become redundant.  Occasional review of any special interoperability measures might reveal opportunities for an implementation to switch to stricter handling of exceptional conditions.  Removing special allowances in favor of stricter error reporting restores feedback measures that new implementations can then benefit from.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.6.p.5">Managing and deploying changes can be expensive.  However, it is widely recognized that maintenance is a critical part of the deployment of computer systems for security reasons <a href="#IOTSU" class="xref">[IOTSU]</a>.  Managing updates for interoperability problems represents a small additional cost in exchange for ensuring the ability to interoperate with other users of the network.</p>

</h1>
<p id="rfc.section.7.p.1">Sloppy implementations, lax interpretations of specifications, and uncoordinated extrapolation of requirements to cover gaps in specification can result in security problems.  Hiding the consequences of protocol variations encourages the hiding of issues, which can conceal bugs and make them difficult to discover.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.7.p.2">Designers and implementers of security protocols generally understand these concerns.  However, general-purpose protocols are not exempt from careful consideration of security issues.  Furthermore, because general-purpose protocols tend to deal with flaws or obsolescence in a less urgent fashion than security protocols, there can be fewer opportunities to correct problems in protocols that develop interoperability problems.</p>
